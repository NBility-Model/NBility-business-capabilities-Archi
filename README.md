## Preparing your Github account to configure Archi integration

1. Log onto your GitHub Account at [GitHub.com](github.com) or create a GitHub account at [GitHub.com](github.com)
2. To configure Archi for Github integration you would need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) from your user account.  For a detailed overview of the process you can visit https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

Alternatively, you can follow the steps below:

### Create a Github Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Select [**Settings**] from your account menu (look for the avatar at the right-top of the page)
   
![coArchi-github-settings](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/blob/main/images/Settings.PNG)

2. Select [**Developer settings**] from the menu on the left-hand of the page

![coArchi-github-developer-settings](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Developer%20settings.PNG)
   
3. Select [**Personal access tokens**] and then [**Tokens (classic)**]
4. Select [**Generate new token**] and then [**Generate new token (classic)**]
5. Enter your token name, set the token expiry and select the [**repo**] scope for the token
   
![coArchi-new-token](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/blob/main/images/New_personal_access_token.PNG)   

7. Click [**Generate token**]
8. Copy the token from the screen and store it securely for configuration purposes.  **IMPORTANT**: YOU CANNOT RETRIEVE THE TOKEN AFTER IT HAS BEEN GENERATED AND DISPLAYED ON THIS PAGE.  IF YOU LOOSE IT YOU WILL NEED TO GENERATE A NEW TOKEN.

### Import the model into Archi from Github

Once you have configured Archi and coArchi, and generated your Github Personal Access Token (PAT) you will be able to import the Nbility model into archi.

1. In Archi, select [**Import Remote Model to Workspace**] from **Collaboration** menu.  You may need to provide Archi a master password to unlock this feature. **IMPORTANT**: YOU CANNOT RETRIEVE THE MASTER PASSWORD AFTERWARDS. IF YOU LOOSE IT YOU MAY WILL NEED TO REINSTALL ARCHI.

![coArchi-add-remote-model](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Add%20remote%20model.PNG)

2. In the **Add Remote Model** modal, provide the following information:

| Field       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| URL         | The full web URL of the repo: https://github.com/username/reponame.git |
| User Name   | Your Github user name |
| Password    | The Github Personal Access Token (PAT) you generated earlier |

It is possible that you could use your GitHub credentials as-is in the screen.  However, it is recommended that you enable 2FA on your Github account to protect access to the repo.  In this case you will only be able to log onto Github from Archi using the Github Personal Access Token (PAT).

To obtain the repo URL, you can copy of from the **Clone** address:

## Navigating the UI

1. In Archi, select [**Toggle Collaboration Workspace**] and [**Toggle Branches View**] from the **Collaboration** menu.  The Workspace and Branch windows will be docked within Archi.  Archi/coArchi supports repository branches.

![coArchi-navigate-ui](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Archi%20UI.PNG)

The Collaboration Workspace is used to navigate between different models and individual branches checked out while the Branches View provide the ability to manipulate branches within the selected model. 

## Refresh model

**IMPORTANT: To ensure that the local repository remains synchronized with the upstream repository and to prevent overwriting any changes made since the last pull from the server, it is crucial to refresh the model from GitHub before applying any modifications.** Regular refreshs of the model not only maintain alignment with the upstream repository but also mitigate the risk of merge conflicts.

1. To refresh your local copy of the model, open the model / branch from the Collaboration Workspace and select [**Refresh Model**] from the **Collaboration** application menu.

![coArchi-refresh-model](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Refresh%20model%20part%202.PNG)

Alternatively, you can - in archi - select [**Toggle Collaboration Workspace**] from the **Collaboration** application menu and refresh Model there.

![coArchi-refresh-model-alternative](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Refresh%20model.PNG)

## Add new branch

To protect the integrity of the main branch and avoid overwriting updates from someone else, it is recommended to create a branch for each new piece of work.  Branches could be named by feature_[**topic name**] or fix_[**topic name**].  Branches can be created either through the coArchi plugin or via Github.com.

### Via the coArchi plugin

1. In Archi, select [**Toggle Branches View**] from the **Collaboration** menu.

![coArchi-branches](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Branches%20view.PNG)

2. In Branches Workspace, click on the [**Add branch**] icon.

![coArchi-add-branche](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Add%20branch.PNG)

3. Select [**Add branch and checkout**]. This will create the local topic branch and set it as the active branch. This action won't create the upstream branch (on [Github server](https://github.com/NBility-Model) yet).

![coArchi-add-branch](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Add_branch_part%202.PNG)

4. The final step is to publish the new topic branch. This will make the new topic branch available on [GitHub.co](https://github.com/NBility-Model). To publish your new topic branch, select [**Publish changes**] from the **Collaboration** menu.

![coArchi-publish-changes](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Publish%20changes.PNG)

5. To ensure that your new topic branch have been successfully published, you can verify by visiting your topic branch on https://github.com/NBility-Model to see if your new topic branch appears in the specific repository you've worked on.


## Switch branch

1. In Archi, select [**Toggle Branches View**] from the **Collaboration** menu.
2. In archi, right click on the branch you like to switch to and click on [**Switch branch**].

![coArchi-switch-branch](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Switch%20Branch.PNG)


## Committing and publishing changes

1. To commit your latest changes, select [**Commit changes**] from the **Collaboration** menu. 

![coArchi-commit](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Commit%20changes.PNG)

2.  Enter your user details and a commit message. By committing changes you create a local snapshot of the repository into a single package. **IMPORTANT: This does not upload the changes to the upstream branch, but only create a local packaged copy**.

![coArchi-commit-part2](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Commit%20changes%20part%202.PNG)

3. The final step is to publish the committed package back to the upstream repository. This will insert the last committed package into the upstream branchat GitHub.com. To publish your latest changes, select [**Publish changes**] from the **Collaboration** menu.

![coArchi-publish-changes](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Publish%20changes.PNG)

4. To ensure that your changes have been successfully committed and published, you can verify by visiting https://github.com/NBility-Model to see if your commit appears in the specific branch you've worked on.

## Create Pull Request Review and Merge Topic Branch

On regular intervals all committed and published branches need to be merged into the main branch which will trickle down into all subsequent branches.

1. Log onto your GitHub Account at [GitHub.com](github.com) 
2. In https://github.com/NBility-Model, create a Github pull request from your topic branch on by clicking on the button [**Compare & Pull Request**].

![coArchi-create-pull-request](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Create%20Pull%20request.PNG)

3. Add a title and description to your pull request. To finalize your pull requestion, click on the button [**Create pull request**].

![coArchi-create-pull-request](https://github.com/NBility-Model/nbility-model.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/Create%20Pull%20request%20part%202.PNG)

4. Pull requests will be reviewed by one of the maintainers of NBility Model who may discuss, offer constructive feedback, request changes, or approve the work. 

5. Upon receiving the sign-off of one of the maintainers of NBility Model you may merge your changes, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request a maintainer to merge it for you.
